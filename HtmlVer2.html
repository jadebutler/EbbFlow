<p> class="lead-in">  ,</a> Web is a new media and one that is constantly changing. We should not stay stuck in the past but instead evolve with the changing of the time, much like the teachings of Daoism philosophy.

<p>A Dao of Web Design includes quotes from the Tao Te Ching. A book of Chinese philosophy that emphasize the importance of

<p>flexibility
<p>harmony
<p>change

<p>You should take into account that the reader might be far or near sighted and ensure that your media is accessible and user friendly to all.

Being able to adapt in this field is essential.

As the world is constantly changing, so must you. Change is difficult for some and we should not forget the hundreds of years of work that came before us. We must honor the past, but understand that the web is new and it is a media that is constantly evolving. It is our job to embrace it and explore that endless possibilities that the web has to offer.
