Web is a new media and one that is constantly changing. Those that are used to printed media such as letters, 
books and newspapers often find the web daunting and refuse to submit to change. There is a rising tension between the old ways of printed media vs. the web. We should not stay stuck in the past but instead evolve with the changing of the time, much like the teachings of Daoism philosophy.


_A Dao of Web Design_ includes quotes from the Tao Te Ching. A book of Chinese philosophy that emphasize the
importance of 

* flexibility
* harmony 
* change 

Theses quotes are used to relate back to web design and show just how 
relevant they are in modern day society.


You should take into account that the reader might be far or near sighted and ensure 
that your media is accessible and user friendly to all. 

Being able to adapt is essential in this field.

As the world is constantly changing, so must you. 
Change is difficult for some and we should not forget the hundreds of years of work that came before us. 
We must honor the past, but understand that the web is new and it is a media that is constantly evolving. 
It is our job to embrace it and explore that endless possibilities that the web has to offer.
